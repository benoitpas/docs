Initially I thought the concept of 'modern C++' quite funny: I learnt the language in the early 1990s with probably the 2nd edition of [The C++ Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language)
(I'm not sure of the edition as a friend borrowed the book and I never saw them again - both the friend and the books ;-) ). 

In the late 90s I was working on a wireless network planning tool written in C++. The code base was fairly old and
didn't use the STL very well. Then we ported to Windows, mostly using C# so my understanding of C++ stayed frozen in time. And that version of the language I remember could certainly not be called modern, especially compared to C#.

Then comes the 2020s, a friend mentions 'Modern C++' and explains the new features (lambdas ! less error prone memory management !) so I gave it a go and implemented a tree algorithm with various variant of C++: https://github.com/benoitpas/c-tree

Also here is a resource to learn more: [CS 3520 Programming in C++](http://www.mshah.io/comp/Summer21/cpp/public/index.php)
