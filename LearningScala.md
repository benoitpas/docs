# Ressources to learn Scala

## Structured courses
### Unavoidable: Martin's EPFL courses
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala

The first 2 are a particular must have (done):
*Functional programming in Scala https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1?specialization=scala
* Functional program design in Scala https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2?specialization=scala

## TypeLevel books 
Theses are the books on which TypeLevel base their training, they are great resources as they introduce core concepts with exercices. They do no introduce all aspects of Scala but focus on the 'algebraic datatype'/pure functional approach

todo: list the books

+scala excerizes, great online exercises

## Books
