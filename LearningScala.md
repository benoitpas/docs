# Ressources to learn Scala

## Structured courses
### Unavoidable: Martin's EPFL courses
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala

The first 2 are a particular must have (done):
* Functional programming in Scala https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1?specialization=scala
* Functional program design in Scala https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2?specialization=scala

## Underscore books - Pure Functional programming in Scala
Theses are the books on which TypeLevel base their training, they are great resources as they introduce core concepts with exercices. They do)  no introduce all aspects of Scala but focus on the 'algebraic datatype'/pure functional approach.

* Essential Scala (https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/) is a great scala introductory book for people who already know how to program
* Scala with Cats (https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/) is the next step after Essential Scala, it presents how to structure programs using the 'Cats' library that enforces a pure functional approach.
* The Type Astronaut's Guide to Shapeless Book (https://underscore.io/books/shapeless-guide/) is another advanced book. It introduces Shapeless, a library used to reduce boiler plate when implementing standard functions (like json generation) on complex datastructures.

Other more specialized books are also available, for example on the Play framework or Lift (https://underscore.io/books/).

Scala exercices (https://www.scala-exercises.org/) is a web site with interactive tests on the https://underscore.io/books/Underscore ecosystem (Cats and Shapeless are covered for example). It is a great complement to the books.

## Reference Books## 

* Martin Odersky book: reference book, I use it to read on a specific subject not great introductory material

## Websites
* All About Scala (http://allaboutscala.com/): lots of good step by step tutorials
