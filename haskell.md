Having used Haskell for a few [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), here are some useful on-line resources to learn this very neat language.

* [Programming in Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) from [Graham Hutton](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/), excellent introductory text book, base for the course https://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/introduction-to-functional-programming/ run by the very entertaining [Erik Meijer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)).
* [Effective Haskell book](https://pragprog.com/titles/rshaskell/effective-haskell/)
* [Real World Haskell book](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
* [Lean you haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell The Wiki is really good, it includes introduction to Haskell for beginners until advanced topics, both theoretical like functors and category theory as well as practical, i.e how to debug and optimize the code.
