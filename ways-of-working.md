A few articles that are useful reference when discussing "Ways of working" to avoid re-inventing the wheel (or naive approach like using 'Story points' to measure productivity):

* Quite related, I highly value the SVPG group work, "Product Mindset" is key to have impact: [From Projects to Product](https://www.svpg.com/from-projects-to-products/)
