A few articles that are useful reference when discussing "Ways of working" to avoid re-inventing the wheel (or naive approach like using 'Story points' to measure productivity):
* Actually, on productivity: [Dan North reply on a McKinsey article](https://dannorth.net/mckinsey-review/)
* Quite related, I highly value the SVPG group work, "Product Mindset" is key to have impact: [From Projects to Product](https://www.svpg.com/from-projects-to-products/)
* Management advice, also great to understand how to present projects/status to higher level, Camille Fournier's [The manager's path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/).
* Good checklist to start a new job (or re-evaluate your current one !) even if for non CTO: [https://rajiv.com/blog/2016/04/19/90-day-plan-for-a-cto-in-a-new-job/].
